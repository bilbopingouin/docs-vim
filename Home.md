Welcome to the vim_settings wiki!

Since this project is about configuration files for vim, there isn't probably much need for further discussion/explanations. However, I have a few tips/hints/summary of some vim commands, and I'll add them here. Again, it is intended to be for me, but might be useful for someone.
