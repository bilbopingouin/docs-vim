# Vim tips and tricks

This is a collection of tips and tricks that I gathered for my own usage. But I thought that they might be of use to other people as well.

They were originally on the [wiki](https://github.com/bilbopingouin/vim_settings/wiki) of my [vim_settings](https://github.com/bilbopingouin/vim_settings) repository.

The content can be accessed [here](docs/toc.md).
