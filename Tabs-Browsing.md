# Tabs Browsing

Tabs is a great feature of vim! Some commands may be interesting

### Basic

- `:tabne[w]`
- `:tabe[dit] file`
- `:tabn[ext]` / `gt`
- `:tabp[rev]` / `gT`
- `:tabfind`
- `:tabclose`

### Slightly more advanced

- `<C-w> gf`       opens file under cursor in a new tab
- `<C-w> gF`       like previous, but jumps to line number
- `:tabm`          moves a tab
- `:tab help`      opens help in a tab
- `:tabdo {cmd}`   run cmd on all tabs. To some extend it is similar to `:bufo`
- `:tabs`          list all current tabs
