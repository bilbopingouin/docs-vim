Welcome to the **vim_settings** wiki!

Since this project is about configuration files for vim, there isn't probably much need for further discussion/explanations. 

However, I have a few tips/hints/summary of some vim commands, and I'll add them here. They may provide some rationale behind the given configuration as can be found in the repository, but they extend it by including some commands. Note that they suppose a very basic knowledge of the ViM editor (otherwise, look up [here](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vim+tutorial&t=ffsb)).

Again, it is intended to be for me, but might be useful for someone.

The variopus categories can be found on the right side. However, if you don't know where to start, I'd recommend to have a look at the [Essentials](essentials).
