# Specific Configuration

### Incrementation C-A, C-X

When incrementing, numbers starting with 0x are recognised as hexa and the ones starting with 0 as octal. Since I never work with octal numbers and that I sometimes defined decimal starting from 0, I set the formats as

    :se nrformats=hex

also possible values are `octal` and `alpha`.

### Abreviations

Some abbreviations. Particularly useful for mails.
